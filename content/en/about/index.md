I'm a **budding software developer** by profession, an occassional poet, sometimes an artist with an (unhealthy) addiction to shopping, eating dumplings and going out. My friends say I can be quite dramatic and sometimes show too much emotion (the jury is out about whether this is a bad thing). I also love most four-legged animals that I can potentially cuddle. I have two dogs - Cookie and Cheeni who mean the world to me.

Meet my doggos here!:
