I'm a **budding software developer** by profession, an occassional poet, sometimes an artist with an unhealthy addiction to shopping, eating dumplings and going out. My friends say I can be quite dramatic and sometimes show too much emotion(The jury is out about whether this is a bad thing). I also love most four-legged animals that I can potentially cuddle. I have two dogs - Cookie and Cheeni(translates to sugar) and believe in the philosophy of "More the Merrier"(just with dogs):

Meet my darling babies here!:
