# A place where confessions run rampant (by a single person).

This website is a shameless tribute to most of the work I do and am allowed to demonstrate. 

# Who am I?

This is a difficult question to answer but professionally I am a graduate student at Boston University. So far I have really enjoyed working in Systems in Computer Science and hope to be able to work more in this field. I'm not necessarily the best at it but my current works involves learning how to efficiently optimize LSM (Log Structured Merge) trees. I am working presently under Professor Athanassoulis in the DiSC Lab at Boston University with [Andy Hyunh] (https://www.bu.edu/cs/profiles/andy-huynh/). Right now I am trying to figure out Machine Learning techniques that work with Bayesian Optimization to be able to solve this problem.
